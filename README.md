Hello the following repository contains all the labs and homeworks assignments completed in the course IS170 Machine Learning. This course was focused on helping students learn the process in creating and fine tuning machine learning algorithms. Through this process students became more familiar with their coding skills and the efficiency these algorithms can provide. These algorithms typically used real world data and had a purpose. This would give students an idea on how to apply these learned algorithms to real life problems. The algorithms included the creation of Natural Language processing models, regression models, and many more, which are listed in detail in the repository. The goal of this class brought students up to speed in their knowledge on algorithms and more efficient ways of analyzing data.

A table of contents is availabe that can be used to navigate through the different algorithms covered throughout the course.

Each branch has a summary on the algorithm along with the code for the algorithm typically applied to a real life scenario.
