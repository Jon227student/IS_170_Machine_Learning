Lab 1 was a introductory lab where students learned how to manually calculate the deep learning algorithim on paper which is used in machine learning. This lab gave students an understanding of the order of calculations a deep learning algorithm uses along with the use of biases, weights, summanation functions, and activation functions. The students then calculated the total error their model produced which shows how well their model is performing and then utilized gradient descent to further improve their total error. This also brought an understanding of different paremeters that the model creator can change and adjust such as the amount of hidden layers, the amount of neurons in the hidden layer nodes, the optimizer function, learning rate, and the activation function. There are other parameters that can be adjusted but this Lab essentially focused on those.
