Support Vector Machine

Support vector machine is a popular classification algorithm used in machine learning. In the homework file, the algorithm was applied to predict the presence of kidney stones in patients based on various features such as gravity, pH, osmo, cond, urea, calcium.

The results showed that the SVM model correctly identified 42.85% of all positive instances of people with kidney stones. This means that out of all the patients with kidney stones, the model correctly identified 42.85% of them as having the disease.The model had a perfect precision score, with 100% of the patients identified as having kidney stones actually having the disease.

While the model's sensitivity could be improved by further changing the SVM parameters or using additional features, the high precision indicates that it can be useful in clinical settings to help accurately identify patients with kidney stones.SVM is a versatile algorithm that can be applied in various fields such as image classification, text classification, and fraud detection.
