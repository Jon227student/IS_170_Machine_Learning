Big City Taxi Fare Deep Learning Model 

This lab was a test of our knowledge and ability to create a deep learning model by hand. We were provided a CSV file containing data from taxi rides in New York that required feature engineering to function correctly within the model. This model was created on paper without any outside assistance. Our goal was to devise a model capable of predicting the fare amount based on the features and parameters of the ride data. Additionally, we were required to create our own feature to help train the model and improve its ability to predict the fare of a ride. This feature was named Euclidean distance. It was a substantial mathematical function that subtracted the latitude and longitude of pickup coordinates from the latitude and longitude of drop-off coordinates. The procedure then squared the result from the subtracted longitude and latitude, added them together, and finally, took the root of the resultant sum. I assume this step was to scale the answer in some way to better optimize it for our model. We were then supposed to replicate this model two more times but with different parameters and functions. This lab exerted pressure on us but also highlighted our reliance on outside help when creating these models previously. It showcased the areas where we needed to improve and retain knowledge.
