K-Means clustering

K-Means clustering is a type of unsupervised learning algorithims that is used in machine learning. It is used to seperate a dataset into K clusters based on similarity. The K represents the clusters that are formed from the dataset. The amount of clusters can be changed through the coding of the algorithim. Each cluster is given a centroid point which is the mean of each cluster. Once the centroids no longer move around the process is complete.

The algorithim created in the file HW 4 has a series of locations with constant traffic from doordash deliverers who travel is by bicycle. It bases each cluster on the amount of demand each location recieeves and also the time the demands is at its peak. It shows that many locations may have similar demand but the difference and seperation is created because they are at different times of the day. Some locations are experience low traffic all througout the day and are in their own cluster of other locations that also experience low demand and traffic. 

K-Means clustering is a useful way to visualize data and perform data analysis. It can help identify patterns and similarities within the data. It can also help identify outliers that lie far away from their centroid.
