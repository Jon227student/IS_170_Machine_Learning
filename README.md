Amazon Web Service Deep Racer Project

In this lab we created our own racers on Amazon's Deep Racer competition. This competition consists of models trained via reinforcement learning. It was up to us to modify the provided code to make changes to the effectivness of the models peformance. We chose our discount rate and the racing line selected by the model. My lab partner and I decided to opt for a riskier model, but to counter this we wanted to give it a very long amount to train. Our model did exceptionally well and after the training, it was well adapted to our selected track. This lab taught us how even the slightest adjustments to the models code really effected the behavior. We discobered that adjusting the way the model percieves speed allowed it to improve its overall average speed. This was rewarding and motivated my partner and I to really try and dial in our model. It was really cool to visualize reinforcment learning and view the model training live.
