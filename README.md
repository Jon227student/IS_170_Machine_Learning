Prompt Engineering (Stable Diffusion)

The primary aim of this lab was to provide students with experience in using Stable Diffusion, a generative AI tool designed for generating and editing images. The lab also put a focus on prompt engineering, a technique where users guide AI models using specific textual prompts to achieve desired outputs. This model has been trained on billions of images. It is considered a latent diffusion model that differs from tradtional models. The way the model works resembles the process of diffusion in physics. Noise is added to the training image turning it into a noise image which has no characteristics. It then reverses this process where the noise image is converted into an original image based on the training image. We were required to start with a basic prompt and increase in its complexity and details until we ended up with a very vibrant detailed photo. I chose a blue whale as my original prompt and then increased the details in increments until I ended up with a detailed ocean floor with sea stars and crabs along with underwater volcanoes in the background.
