IMG2IMG (Stable Diffusion)

In this lab, we continued our familiarity with Stable Diffusion, utilizing several adjustable features such as inpainting, noise reduction, and masked inpainting. Inpainting involves filling in missing or corrupted parts of images. When using Stable Diffusion for inpainting, users create a mask to indicate the areas for the tool to regenerate, and then the model works to fill in these areas with appropriate image content. Masked inpainting further refines this process by allowing users to specify which parts of an image to focus on, offering a more controlled inpainting experience. Denoising involves reducing noise to improve image quality. Through the combination of these features, Stable Diffusion enables a wide array of image creation and editing activities, providing users with a platform to experiment with the artistic possibilities of AI. We were asked to adjust four images, all from different categories. For my selected images, I chose a coral reef setting, a Golden Doodle next to its owner, a BMW F80 M3, and finally, a personal image of my friend Elijah and I.
