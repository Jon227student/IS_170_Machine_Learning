Big City Taxi Fare Deep Learning Model II

In this lab we took our handwritten deep learning models from our previous lab and turned them into functional models in code. This lab would show us our mistakes and errors from our models that were based purely on our existing knowledge at the time. This was a great way to better understand what steps we were missing and if the order of our code was correct. This lab significantly improved our ability to handwrite deep learning models. Since the calculations newly created model require computing power far too much for the average lap top or macbook. We switched over to paperspace which is a cloud computing service. This significantly improved our model load times and increased our computing power further expanding our capabilities with our AI models.
