Association Rules

Association rules are used to discover relationships between items in a dataset and can be used for applications such as market basket analysis and product recommendations. The strength of these relationships are measured using metrics such as support, confidence, lift, and conviction.

Support measures the frequency of occurrence of an itemset in the dataset, while confidence measures the conditional probability of an itemset being purchased given the purchase of another itemset. Lift measures the strength of the association between two itemsets and is calculated as the ratio of the observed frequency of co-occurrence to the expected frequency under independence. Conviction, on the other hand, measures the degree of dependence between two itemsets and is calculated as the ratio of the expected frequency of co-occurrence under independence to the observed frequency of non-co-occurrence.

In the HW file provided below I created my own data for real life scenarios such as a sporting good stores sales and a video game store sales. I then created an algorithm that provides the Support, Conviction, Lift, and Confidence on the sales data. The provided data accuratetly matched the sales and showed the relationships of several items and their occurance with eachother.
