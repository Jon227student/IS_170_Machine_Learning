Text Mining and Natural Language processing 

Text mining is the use of machine learning to analyze large collections of text data. Some examples include books, articles, and social media articles. The algorithms we created focused on text mining which would analyze only keywords in statements and ignore buffer words such as words like the,as,is. These words have no real meaning behind them so ridding of these words would speed up the analyzation process. We also created an algorithm that can detect Sentiment analysis. This allowed algorithms to detect the sentiment of a statement. It was able tell whether a statement was positive, negative, or neutral. It did this by detecting certain words such as good, bad, or average. Esentailly it was given a word database that it afiliiated with certain moods. 

Natural Language processing algorithms were also created in the files provided. This focused on developing algorithms that enable computers to understand and generate natural language. This technology is used in chat bots, virtual assistants, and language translation apps. Our algorithm created a chatbot that would ask the user how their day was and also provide a response. It had several questions and answers to chose from so it did not constantly repeat itself. 

Both of these techniques have enabled computers to process natural language data more accurately and efficiently
