Responsible AI Discussion

This lab was a discussion where we were given articles detailing up and coming issues with the development of AI. Most of these issues were based on AI violating ethics or questioning how an AI will develop its own ethics. This discussion consisted of four different classmates. We all seemed to come to certain agreements on all of these issues. We agreed that an AI should judge people and applicantes based on the contents of their character and nothing of their physical look or gender. We decided that the reason this is important to initally consider and implement is because we would want to avoid an AI developing a strong bias and judgement factor on gender. This could really hinder diversity and allow an AI to operate with an unfair selection process. This discussion was neccassary becausse these are the real world issues appearing today. Some are really controversial and have no clear answer. The one that none of us had a solution for, was thearticle discussing whether authors or artists should be awarded compentsation for their work that AI models are trained on, which are then used to create new work and art from the AI model. We know this issue will be addressed in the future and the amount of artist and authors that may be compensated are large. How they go about this will be interesting. This was a great discussion and with our knowledge of AI I feel my classmates and I came to some really good solutions.
