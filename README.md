Big City Taxi Fare Deep Learning Model 

This lab was a test of our knowledge and ability to create a deep learning model by hand. We were given a csv file containing data from taxi rides in New york that required feature engineering to correctly function with the model. This model was created on paper with no outside help. Our goal was to create a model that could predict the fare amount based on the features and parameters of the ride data. We were also required to create our own feature. That would help train the model to improve its ability to predict the fare of a ride. This feature was called eucilean distance. It was a large math function that subtracted the latitude and longitude pickup coordinates from the latitude and longitude dropoff coordinates. It would then square the answer from the subtracted longitude and latitude and then add them together, the final step was to take the root of the remaining output. I am assuming this is to scale the answer in some ways so it is better optimized for out model. We were then suppose to replicate this model two more times but with different paremeters and functions. This lab really put pressure on us but also exposed our reliance on outside help when creating these models previously. It showed where we needed to improve and remember.
