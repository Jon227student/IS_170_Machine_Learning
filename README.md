Deep Learning CNN with Dot Product

This was a two-part lab. In the first part, we were required to create a simple neural network on paper; this time, we only needed to perform the multiplication steps where the input values and hidden layer nodes are multiplied to achieve an output node value. The summation and activation functions were not used. This lab required us to construct our own neural network, choosing the values ourselves. This exercise enhanced our understanding of the structure of a neural network and allowed us to visualize the relationships between the different layers. In the second part of the lab, we had to code the neural network we created. This entailed assigning values to the input and hidden layer nodes via code. Subsequently, we had to produce a visualization of our neural network in the code to confirm that we had correctly transcribed our handwritten neural network. This served as our initial introduction to the coding aspect of neural networks and deep learning models.
