Hello the following repository contains all the labs and homeworks assignments completed in the course IS170 Machine Learning and IS160 AI in business. IS170 was focused on helping students learn the process in creating and fine tuning machine learning algorithms. IS160 taught students how to utilize AI in business. We learned how a deep learning model worked then applied these models to real life datasets to see the effectiveness and accuracy these models can provide. Through IS170 students became more familiar with their coding skills and the efficiency these algorithms can provide. IS160 then used the coding and feature engineering skills learned to create and understand deep learning models which is also an algorithim itself. These models created typically used real world data and had a hypothetical purpose. This would give students an idea on how to apply these learned algorithms to real life problems. The algorithms learned in IS170 included the creation of Natural Language processing models, regression models, and many more, which are listed in detail in the repository. The goal of these classes brought students up to speed in their knowledge on algorithms and a better understanding of the integration of AI in the business sector, overall giving students an advantage while also preparing them for the intemiment changes that may effect their career. 

A table of contents is availabe that can be used to navigate through the different algorithms covered throughout the courses.

Each branch has a summary on the algorithm along with the code for the algorithm typically applied to a real life scenario. IS160 labs occasionally differ from the same format from the IS170 labs as this course encouraged more of a focus on utilizing prexisting AI models rather than only focusing on the creation of deep learning models.
