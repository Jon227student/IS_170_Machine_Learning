K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used for classification or regression tasks. In the case of loan data in the HW file provided, it is used for classification to predict whether a person is likely to default on their loan or not.

To use KNN for prediction, the algorithm requires labeled data to train on. In the case of loan data, the dataset would consist of features such as income, credit score, loan amount, etc., and a label indicating whether the person defaulted on their loan or not.

Once the algorithm has been trained on the labeled data, it can be used to predict the label of new, unlabeled data points. To do this, the algorithm calculates the distance between the new data point and all the other labeled data points in the training set. It then selects the K nearest data points and assigns the new data point the label that is most common among its K nearest neighbors.

In the case of the loan data, one can enter a new data point with features such as income, credit score, and loan amount, and the KNN algorithm will predict whether this person is likely to default on their loan or not based on the K nearest labeled data points in the training set.

The accuracy of the KNN algorithm can be measured by comparing the predicted labels to the true labels for a set of test data that was not used during training. In the case of the loan data, the 76% accuracy measure means that the algorithm correctly predicted the default or non-default status of the loan for 76% of the test data.
