Hello the following repository contains all the labs and homeworks assignments completed in the course IS170 Machine Learning. This course was focused on helping students learn the process in creating and fine tuning machine learning algorithims. Through this process students became more familiar with their coding skills and the efficeny these algorithims can provide. These algorithims typically used real world data and had a purpose. This would give students an idea on how to apply these learned algorithims to real life problems. The algorithims included the creation of Natural Language processing models and the creation of regression models along with many more listed in detail that are included in the repository. The goal of this class brought students up to speed in their knowledge on algorithims and more efficient ways of analyzing data.

A table of contents is availabe that can be used to navigate through the different algorithims covered throughout the course.

Each branch has a summary on the algorithim along with the code for the algorithim typically applied to a real life scenario.
