Decision Tree

A decision tree is a type of algorithm used in machine learning to classify data. It is a tree-like model that is constructed by recursively splitting the data into smaller and smaller subsets based on the most important features in the data. The goal is to create a tree that can accurately predict the class of new data.

In the HW provided below, the decision tree algorithm was used to classify cars into three classes: US, Europe, and Japan. The features used for classification were cubic inches, cylinders, horsepower, weight, time to reach 60 miles per hour, and year. The decision tree model was able to accurately predict the class of new cars with an accuracy rate of 83.12%

The decision tree algorithm works by selecting the feature that provides the highest reduction in entropy at each node. The tree is built by recursively splitting the data based on these features until a stopping poimt is reached. Decision trees are easy to interpret and can handle both categorical and continuous data.
