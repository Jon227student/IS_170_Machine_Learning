Naive-Bayes 

Naive Bayes is a classification algorithm that is based on Bayes' theorem. It is a simple and effective algorithm for text classification, spam filtering, and sentiment analysis. In the lab provided, we focused on predicting whether a child failed their exam based on test preparation and parental level of education. We used Naive Bayes to classify the students based on these features.

The Naive Bayes algorithm assumes that the features are conditionally independent given the class. This means that each feature contributes independently to the probability of the class, and the presence of one feature does not affect the probability of another feature. 

In the lab, we used a dataset that contained information about students' test preparation and parental level of education, as well as whether they passed or failed their exam. We trained the Naive Bayes algorithm on this data and then tested it on a separate set of data to evaluate its performance. Although we did not receive an accuracy rate in this particular lab, we were able to successfully predict the outcomes for the test data.

Additionally, in another lab, we studied the relationship between the gestation age, height, and body weight of a mother giving birth, as well as whether she was a smoker or not. We used Naive Bayes to classify the mothers based on these features, with the goal of predicting whether or not they were smokers. Through this analysis, we were able to gain insights into the factors that may contribute to smoking during pregnancy.
