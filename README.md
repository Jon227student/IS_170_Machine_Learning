Big City Taxi Fare Deep Learning Model II

In this lab, we transitioned our handwritten deep learning models from the previous lab into functional models in code. This exercise illuminated the mistakes and errors in our models that were based solely on our existing knowledge at the time. It served as a valuable means to better understand the steps we were missing and to verify the correctness of our code sequence. This lab substantially enhanced our ability to handwrite deep learning models. Since the computations required by the newly created models exceed the processing capacity of an average laptop or MacBook, we transitioned to Paperspace, a cloud computing service. This shift significantly improved our model load times and augmented our computing power, thereby expanding our capabilities with our AI models.
