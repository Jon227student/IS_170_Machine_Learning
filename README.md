Deep Learning CNN with Dot Product

This was a two part lab. In the first part we were required to create a simple neural network on paper, this time we just needed to do the multiplication steps where the input values, hidden layers nodes are multiplied to achieve an output node value. The summanation and activation functions are not used. This lab required us to make our own neural network where we chose the values. This gives us a better understanding of the structure of a neural network and allow us to visualize the relationships between the different layers. In second part of the lab we had to code our neural network we created. This required us to assign the input and hidden layer nodes via code. We then had to produce a visualization of our neural netowork in the code to confirm that we correctly coded our handwritten neural network. This was our first introduction to the coding portion of neural networks and deep learning models.
