Manual calculation of Deep learning neural network

Lab 1 was a introductory lab where students learned how to manually calculate the deep learning algorithim on paper which is used in machine learning. This lab gave students an understanding of the order of calculations a deep learning algorithm uses along with the use of  the summanation function, activation function,and cost function. The students then calculated the total error their model produced, which shows how well their model is performing, and then utilized gradient descent to further improve their total error. This lab also brought an understanding of different hyperparemeters that the model creator can change and adjust such as the amount of hidden layers,the amount of input and output nodes, the amount of neurons in the hidden layer nodes, learning rate, the bias values, and the weight values. 

The following photos provided were the hand-written calcuations, it follows the steps of a deep learning model on a smaller scale. It first starts with the forward propagation where the input nodes and bias values are multiplied by the weights. The given values from the calculations are then summed using the summation function. This result is called the total net input. The total net input is then is then fed into the activation function which transforms it into a new output. This new output is then used like the input nodes in the next layer. This step is repeated until the output layer calculations are completed. After the output layer is completed the student then utulizes the cost function to calculate a value that represents how well their model is performing which is called the total error. Gradient descent is then used to decrease this total error value which means the model is performing better. This step required students to calculate the partial derivatives of each weight to discover their effect on the total errror. The weights can then be adjusted to improve performance. The total error of functions and calculations are also included.The model created is supposed to predict whether an  8x8 pixel image is an image of a chicken or a man.
