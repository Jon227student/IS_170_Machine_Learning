Reinforcement Learning Diagram 

In this lab we were given the task of creating several tasks and putting them in a format situated to reinforcment learning. We made several states for each scenario and identified the agent and reward. This was our introduction to reinforcement learning and this lab allowed us to repeatedly apply scenarios into a reinforcement learning format. We began to become familiarized with this concept and actions. This lab also taught us the terms used and their purposes. Reinforcement learning is very interesting and in a simplified concept would be as if you were gamifying a task which offer rewards for success and penalties for failure. Over time the successful behavior and actions can be identified and repeated.
